These are my attempts at solving the exercises in [Functional Programming in Scala](http://www.worldcat.org/title/functional-programming-in-scala/oclc/823712614) by [@pchiusano](https://github.com/pchiusano) and [@runarorama](https://github.com/runarorama).

Throughout this effort, I'm going to limit my viewing of the information in the [fpinscala](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala) repo to just the <tt>hint</tt> files.
